/**
 * Default variable overrides against bootstrap's for future / deprecated components.
 *
 * This is a collection of carried-over variable changes from before CSS Modules, and should be
 * phased out as components get built and override the default bootstrap components. As of now,
 * no components actually use these overrides and so this is left more for documentation purposes
 * when future components using these overrides are built, or when deprecated components are fully
 * removed.
 *
 * As such, we don't actually use these overrides when building bootstrap and users of these
 * components shouldn't import this file as well.
